# Allclaims Pro – AI Microservices Platform

I built and operate a production system of AI-powered microservices that assist claims intelligence workflows.

Highlights
- Built a RAG chatbot leveraging company data to streamline information retrieval for internal users.
- Delivered an AI-driven service that automated a previously manual review process, reducing processing time from ~15 minutes per person to ~2 minutes of compute.
- Designed, implemented, and maintained backend APIs and data processing services.
- Prioritized reliability and performance with structured logging, metrics, and alerting.
- Collaborated with product and domain teams to scope features and translate requirements into robust implementations.

Impact
- Reduced processing time significantly via workflow automation and retrieval-augmented assistance.
- Improved observability with actionable dashboards and alerts to shorten time-to-detection.
- Standardized build/release practices across services for faster, safer iteration.
