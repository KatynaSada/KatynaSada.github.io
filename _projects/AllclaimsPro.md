# Allclaims Pro – AI Microservices Platform

I built and operate a production system of AI-powered microservices that assist claims intelligence workflows.

Highlights
- Designed, implemented, and maintained backend APIs and data processing services using FastAPI and Python.
- Built model-serving endpoints with containerized deployments and automated CI/CD.
- Prioritized reliability and performance with structured logging, metrics, and alerting.
- Collaborated with product and domain teams to scope features and translate requirements into robust implementations.

Impact
- Reduced service latency through targeted profiling and optimization.
- Improved observability with actionable dashboards and alerts to shorten time-to-detection.
- Standardized build/release practices across services for faster, safer iteration.
