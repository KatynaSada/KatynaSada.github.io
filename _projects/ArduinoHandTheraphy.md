# Arduino Hand Theraphy
The objective of this project was to provide a friendly neurorehabilitation system for patients with hand dysfunction. In this project the rehabilitation of the hand is achieved through repetition of movements, with the help of a game so that the patient can perform the exercises in a more bearable way. Constant stimulation helps the brain to create and retain the new neural pathways it is building.
