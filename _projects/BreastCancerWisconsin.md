# Breast Cancer Wisconsin
The goal of this project was to develop an algorithm that correctly predicts whether a breast cancer cell sample is benign or malignant using Kaggle's Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. For this purpose, several machine learning algorithms were compared taking into account their accuracy and execution time.

# The Movies Project

The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.

## Components

Everything in React is a component, and these usually take the form of JavaScript classes. You create a component by extending upon the `React-Component` class. Let’s create a component called `Hello`.

```javascript
class Hello extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello world!</h1>;
    }
}
```


You then define the methods for the component. In our example, we only have one method, and it’s called `render()`.

Inside `render()` you’ll return a description of what you want React to draw on the page. In the case above, we simply want it to display an `h1` tag with the text _Hello world!_ inside it.

To get our tiny application to render on the screen we also have to use `ReactDOM.render()`:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
    <Hello />,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```
