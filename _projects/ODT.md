# Optimal Decision Trees (ODT)

This project highlights my contributions exploring the ODT algorithm for personalized medicine. ODT builds an optimal decision tree by solving an optimization problem at each split, assigning treatments that optimize a chosen sensitivity measure while respecting group size constraints. The method leverages genomic/mutational and drug sensitivity data to recommend robust, individualized therapies.

- Focus: interpretable, optimization-driven treatment recommendations
- Stack: R, optimization, clinical/omics data integration
