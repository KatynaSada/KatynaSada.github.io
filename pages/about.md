# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:

I'm a PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence for Cancer Research at Tecnun, Universidad de Navarra. I specialize in data analytics, high‑performance computing, and modern machine/deep learning. My work bridges research and real-world impact—designing robust models and systems that aim to improve people's health and quality of life.

Previously, after completing a BSE in Biomedical Engineering, I pursued an MSc in Biomedical Data Analytics, where I strengthened my foundations in bioinformatics and scalable computing. Today, I split my time between advancing research projects and building applied AI solutions.
