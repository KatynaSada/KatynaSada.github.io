# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
PhD student at Tecnun, Universidad de Navarra with expertise in data analytics, high performance computing, deep learning and machine learning.

Upon finishing my degree in biomedical engineering, I decided to enter the world of bioinformatics by enrolling in a Master’s in Biomedical Data Analytics. There, I confirmed my passion for programming and high-performance computing, which helped me take my next big step. I’m currently working on a deep learning model for medical purposes. In the coming years, I want to continue my research regarding people's health.
