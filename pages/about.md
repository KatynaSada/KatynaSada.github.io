# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:

I’m a PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence for Cancer Research at Tecnun, Universidad de Navarra. I work on data analytics, high‑performance computing, and modern machine/deep learning. I care about building things people can actually use—especially when they help patients and teams make clearer decisions.

Before my PhD, I studied Biomedical Engineering (BSE) and completed an MSc in Biomedical Data Analytics, where I focused on bioinformatics and scalable computing.

Day to day, I design and deploy ML models, run analyses, and build data pipelines that scale. I try to make results easy to understand and explain. I split my time between research and applied work, usually with interdisciplinary teams. When a topic grabs my attention, I go deep, take notes, and share what I learn.
